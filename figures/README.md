# Rummagene Figures

To generate the figures, run `make build`.

See `Makefile` for the order in which these scripts are executed, and for additional recipes to generate some of the downloadable files.

The makefile will:
- download necessary dependent files (mostly the rummagene database)
- install required python dependencies in a virtual environment
- generate supplemental files
- generate the figures
