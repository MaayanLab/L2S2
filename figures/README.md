# Rummagene Figures

To generate the figures, run `make build`. See `Makefile` for the order in which these scripts are executed.

The makefile will:
- download necessary dependent files (mostly the rummagene database)
- install required python dependencies in a virtual environment
- generate supplemental files
- generate the figures
